# Maximum-LikeliHood-Estimator-for-n-grams
The primary concept of the estimator involves determining the likelihood of words in the given sentence appearing together.

In the context of predicting sentence probability,
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is often used to estimate the probability of observing a sequence of words or a sentence.

This involves calculating the likelihood of the observed sentence occurring given a particular language model. 

By estimating the likelihood of different sequences of words, MLE can help determine the most probable or likely sentence according to the given model.
